             Dear Delegates,
             <br><br><br>
             It brings me immense pleasure to welcome you to the All India Political Parties Meet 1991.
             Global
             Finance especially India in the late 80s embodied dynamic dilemmas, where countries struggled
             with
             not only their domestic policies but also the race to align themselves with international
             powers.
             India which had adopted a rather aggressive economic policy post independence to boost the
             internal
             growth had opened gates to foreign companies with arguably the most influential economic policy.
             The
             committee entails a diverse set of political and financial issues as we intend towards
             comprehensive
             and fruitful debate. As much content-rich the committee is, the essence of an AIPPM lies at the
             heart of the committee executive board, ready to embrace the drama that is to ensue. Delegates
             will
             be put in shoes of some of the most iconic politicians to have ever stepped into Indian
             political
             stage, so as much as heated debates we expect a bit of light-heartedness will go a long way as
             the
             penultimate intention is to cherish the grand Indian politics.
             <br><br>
             Kindly do not hesitate to reach out to any of the executive board members incase of a doubt, we
             aim
             to make this a memorable and a learning experience for all.
             <br><br>
             Regards, <br>
             Vaanchhit Agarwal (Chairperson)<br>
             Shubhayu Chakraborty (Vice Chairperson)<br>
